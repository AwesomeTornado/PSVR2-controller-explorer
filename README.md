This is THE FIRST _FULLY_ open source project working on reverse engineering the PSVR2 Controllers.

If you are like me, and are frustrated by the abundance of closed source projects surrounding the PSVR2 and its incredible features, Welcome! This project is still in its infancy, and I don't have much time to work on it, but it already has support for the following:
- Adaptive Triggers
- Multiple Rumble Modes

(Note: the actual haptics are still a work in progress.)

Please feel free to add a pull request with a text file containing any of your own personal findings! Projects like these thrive on shared information, so I hope you are able to find my discoveries helpfull, and maybe even contribute some of your own.
