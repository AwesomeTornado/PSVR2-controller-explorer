This is THE FIRST _FULLY_ open source project working on reverse engineering the PSVR2 Controllers with adaptive trigger support. Check out some of the visuals below!

If you are like me, and are frustrated by the abundance of closed source projects surrounding the PSVR2 and its incredible features, Welcome! This project is still in its infancy, and I don't have much time to work on it, but it already has support for the following:
- Adaptive Triggers
- Multiple Rumble Modes
- Controller IMU data

Though not likely to happen, it is also my goal to get the following working:
- Audio based haptics (through bluetooth)
- Headset haptics
- Headset eye tracking

Please feel free to add a pull request with a text file containing any of your own personal findings! Projects like these thrive on shared information, so I hope you are able to find my discoveries helpfull, and maybe even contribute some of your own.


**A note about the source code of this project.
This project is built on top of https://github.com/nondebug/dualsense and is really more of an ugly patch-on than a full personal creation. Variable names may be mismatched, comments may be incorrect, stuff may be rudundant. If you find any of this, and are frustrated by it, I encourage you to make a Pull Request that fixes it. I would greatly appreciate it.

Massive thanks to all the authors of the following repositories, these have helped massively so far.
