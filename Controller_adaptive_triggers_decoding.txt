33, 0x21:
 first byte - first effect
    Region before the second effect is split into 8'ths. Each bit corrosponds to a snap effect at each region.
    Regions that are near each other may overlap slightly, meaning large regions of force may be defined.
 second byte - End of travel effect
    second mode, MOD 4
        0x00 = none 
        0x01 = end Snap
        0x02 = small end force
        0x03 = large end force
 third byte (0x0F)
    Return speed

34, 0x22:
 first byte - first effect
    Region before the second effect is split into 8'ths. Each bit corrosponds to a region.
    A constant force is placed between the first and last 1's in the input. Intermediate bits have no effect.
 second byte - End of travel effect
 
 third byte (0x0F)
    Return speed
