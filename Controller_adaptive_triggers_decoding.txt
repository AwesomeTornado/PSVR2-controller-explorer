No settings, simply resets the feedback motor. (No haptics)

33, 0x21:
first byte - first effect
    Region before the second effect is split into 8'ths. Each bit corrosponds to a snap effect at each region.
    Regions that are near each other may overlap slightly, meaning large regions of force may be defined.
second byte - End of travel effect
    second mode, MOD 4
        0x00 = none 
        0x01 = end Snap
        0x02 = end force (with tiny dead zone at start)
        0x03 = end force (continous from previous force)
third byte:
    First defined region force
fourth byte:
    Second defined region force
fifth byte:
    Third defined region force
(No setting for fourth defined region exists)
sixth byte:
    End of travel effect force

34, 0x22:
first byte - first effect
    Region before the second effect is split into 8'ths. Each bit corrosponds to a region.
second byte - End of travel effect
        0x00:
            A constant force is placed between the first and last 1's in the input. Intermediate bits have no effect.
            At least two bits are required to be set to 1. No end resistance.
        0x01:
            Continous force, light end snap. Starting point is changed by first set bit in the first byte. No end setting.
        0x02:
            Continous force. Starting point is changed by first set bit in the first byte. No end setting.
        0x03:
            Continous force. Starting point is changed by the first set bit in the first byte.
            Will still activate at end of travel even if first byte == 0x00.
third byte (0xFF)
    Force (But this is no ordinary force, powers of two are unusually weak. why???)
