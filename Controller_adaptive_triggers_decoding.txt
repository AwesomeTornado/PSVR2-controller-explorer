first byte - first effect
    Region before the second effect is split into 8'ths. Each bit corrosponds to a snap effect at each region.
    Regions that are near each other may overlap slightly, meaning large regions of force may be defined.
second byte - End of travel effect
    second mode, MOD 4
        0x00 = none 
        0x01 = end Snap
        0x02 = small end force
        0x03 = large end force
third byte:
    First defined region force
fourth byte:
    Second defined region force
fifth byte:
    Third defined region force
(No setting for fourth defined region exists)
sixth byte:
    End of travel effect force

34, 0x22:
 first byte - first effect
    Region before the second effect is split into 8'ths. Each bit corrosponds to a region.
    A constant force is placed between the first and last 1's in the input. Intermediate bits have no effect.
    At least two 1's are required if second effect is undefined. Otherwise:
 second byte - End of travel effect
        0x00 = No changes. 
        0x01 = Continous force, end snap. Starting point is changed by first byte. No end.
        0x02 = Continous force. Starting point is changed by first byte. No end.
        0x03 = large end force
 third byte (0xFF)
    Force
